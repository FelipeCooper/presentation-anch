Run QA validation (E2E, accessibility, visual checks)

<critical>Use Playwright MCP to run all E2E tests</critical>
<critical>Check ALL PRD and TechSpec requirements before approving</critical>
<critical>QA is NOT complete until ALL checks pass</critical>
<critical>Document ALL bugs found with screenshot evidence</critical>
<critical>Follow the WCAG 2.2 standard</critical>

## Objectives

1. Validate implementation against PRD, TechSpec, and Tasks
2. Run E2E tests with Playwright MCP
3. Verify accessibility (a11y)
4. Perform visual checks
5. Document bugs found
6. Generate final QA report

## Prerequisites / File Locations

- PRD: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/prd.md`
- TechSpec: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/techspec.md`
- Tasks: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/tasks.md`
- Bugs: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/bugs.md`
- Project Rules: @.claude/rules
- Environment: localhost

## Process Steps

### 1. Documentation Analysis (Required)

- Read the PRD and extract ALL numbered functional requirements
- Read the TechSpec and verify implemented technical decisions
- Read the Tasks and check completion status of each task
- Create a verification checklist based on the requirements

<critical>DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP - Understanding requirements is fundamental for QA</critical>

### 2. Environment Setup (Required)

- Verify the application is running on localhost
- Use `browser_navigate` from Playwright MCP to access the application
- Confirm the page loaded correctly with `browser_snapshot`

### 3. E2E Tests with Playwright MCP (Required)

Use Playwright MCP tools to test each flow:

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to application pages |
| `browser_snapshot` | Capture accessible page state (preferable to screenshot for analysis) |
| `browser_click` | Interact with buttons, links, and clickable elements |
| `browser_type` | Fill form fields |
| `browser_fill_form` | Fill multiple fields at once |
| `browser_select_option` | Select options in dropdowns |
| `browser_press_key` | Simulate keys (Enter, Tab, etc.) |
| `browser_take_screenshot` | Capture visual evidence |
| `browser_console_messages` | Check console errors |
| `browser_network_requests` | Check API calls |

For each functional requirement from the PRD:
1. Navigate to the feature
2. Execute the expected flow
3. Verify the result
4. Capture screenshot evidence
5. Mark as PASSED or FAILED

### 4. Accessibility Checks (Required)

Check for each screen/component:

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Interactive elements have descriptive labels
- [ ] Images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Color contrast is adequate
- [ ] Forms have labels associated with inputs
- [ ] Error messages are clear and accessible

Use `browser_press_key` to test keyboard navigation.
Use `browser_snapshot` to verify labels and semantic structure.

### 5. Visual Checks (Required)

- Capture screenshots of main screens with `browser_take_screenshot`
- Verify layouts in different states (empty, with data, error)
- Document visual inconsistencies found
- Verify responsiveness if applicable

### 6. QA Report (Required)

Generate final report in the format:

```
# QA Report - [Feature Name]

## Conclusion
[Final QA assessment]
```

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] PRD analyzed and requirements extracted
- [ ] TechSpec analyzed
- [ ] Tasks verified (all complete)
- [ ] Localhost environment accessible
- [ ] E2E tests executed via Playwright MCP
- [ ] All main flows tested
- [ ] Accessibility verified
- [ ] Evidence screenshots captured
- [ ] Bugs documented (if any)
- [ ] Final report generated

## Important Notes

- Always use `browser_snapshot` before interacting to understand the current page state
- Capture screenshots of ALL bugs found
- If a blocking bug is found, document and report immediately
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors with `browser_console_messages`
- Check API calls with `browser_network_requests`

<critical>QA is only APPROVED when ALL PRD requirements have been verified and are working</critical>
<critical>Use Playwright MCP for ALL interactions with the application</critical>
